# It Takes A Village

## Description
This is my backend capstone for Nashville Software School's Evening 12 Cohort! I built this with React and Django to be a resource toolkit for volunteers and staff that are involved with a local Nashville organization's after-school tutoring program. Since I volunteer with this program as well, I wanted to give back to them in a way that utilized the new skills I've acquired through NSS. It allows volunteers to have quick access to announcements, the weekly tutoring sign-up slots, accordions containing frequently-accessed tutoring resource links, and donation requests posted on a "needs board". Staff have additional permissions to view all registered users and control the site's content, such as posting and deleting new announcements or donation needs.
